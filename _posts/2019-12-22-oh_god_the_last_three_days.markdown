While I knew exactly what I was about to do, I didn't realize that I was 30 now, as in all the energy I had in my college days were long gone and all I could think of was getting some sleep as soon as I'm done, I don't even like sleeping.

Well, for the last 3 days I slept in total of 5 hours, believe me, my wife made sure of it. The rest of the time I was either eating or in the washroom, other than that i spent all day and night just trying my best to finish Ruby, as it's part of the milestone. I wish I got two more days but even if i did get that i would still be wasting previous 2 or 3 days contempleting instead of doing any coding. That's just who I am. I thrive when there's deadline looming but stay away from work if I feel like i have enough time to finish what I am supposed to.

Anyway, I spent the last 3 days trying to finish the 107 number of excercises or whatever you wanna call it, perhaps calling it course material would make more sense. I did end  up finishing it. :D

well I have been coding since I was in middle school and I started with Visual Basics, which I'm sure not many people in these days knows about anymore. Me and My cousin started coding when we were in middle school in visual basics and what we could only manage back then was a calculator in  a procedural way, as that would make the most sense to everyone(procedural) . Back then we didn't have a reliable internet connection (if you know how you can use a phone modem to connect to internet, you would know) and by the time we got broadband internet we both ended up having other priorities in life. Once we got into college we got back into coding as it helped us make our presentations more interesting (we both went to business school as undergrad). Later we realized the potential we have in our hands with the emergence of mobile phone apps. We ended up running an app business (don't really wanna talk about it as it was very simple and any high schooler with the right sense of mind may out perform us compared to what we were back then) in which we weere making profit, but then i got the opportunity to move to USA. I did my cousin didn't, he is still running that business locally, while I got engulfed in the NYC lifestyle, where I consistently had to maintain two different jobs to pay my rent and everything. 

While I did had a background in coding I am no entreprenaur as I lack the social skills to mingle with people, so I just did every other immigrants do, until the point I can save enough money to not to have to keep working two jobs so I can afford an education.

That's how I am here, I didn't choose software engineering, it chose me, since I was in middle school.

P.S. My dream is to become a game developer. :D
